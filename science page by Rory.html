  	<h1> Computer Science And Other Pysical Science </h1>
  	
    <h2> why they are different</h2>
    
    <p> As a science subject, computer science is very different from physical science. Other physical science like physics, chemistry, biology and mathematic are seeking for the truth and explanation of the natural world through observations and experiments. However, computer science is learning the potential capacity and limitation of computers. From the design, characteristic to how could computer solve problems for us.</p>

    <h2> Computer Science Application In Physical Science</h2>

    <p>Just because of the unique characteristic of computer science, it has been used in all walks of ‘science’. Science is all about experiments. Start from the experimental apparatus set ups, then comes to collect, store and process data, finally goes to generate reports. All these steps cannot stand without the help of advance technology and computers. An interesting point is nowadays science students always complain something like “I am not a computer science student, so why should I learn and struggle with coding for my assignment now?”</p>

    <p>In the field of biology, experiments produce exponential amounts of biological data, and computer comes to manage them. Take the human Genome project as an example. It is a project over decade aimed to map out a full human genome. They sequence different person’s DNA, and record different level of expression. Try to link them to different disease, and seeking for the possible cure. <blockquote cite="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2000-01/computers-and-the-hgp/index.html">“Computers are responsible for the DNA searching, alignment, and sequence reassembly; their involvement has greatly improved genome identification results in terms of speed, efficiency, and accuracy.”</blockquote></p>
